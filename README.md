# My Reads

Project 7 Front End Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Overview

A book tracking app built with React / Bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorise books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

We are given a [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) If you choose to start with this template, your job will be to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

Of course, you are free to start this project from scratch if you wish! Just be sure to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## Backend Server

To simplify the development process, we are provided with a backend server to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

## Important Note - Backend Server
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
